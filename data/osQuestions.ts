    idealAnswer: "Direct Communication: sender/receiver name each other explicitly: send(P, msg) and receive(Q, msg). A link exists automatically between each pair; each pair has exactly one link. Simpler but less flexible—if a process name changes, code must change. Indirect Communication: messages go to/from mailboxes (ports) with an ID: send(mailboxA, msg) and receive(mailboxA, msg). Multiple processes can share a mailbox; more flexible and decoupled. Example: processes sharing a mailbox can communicate without knowing each other's IDs.",

(2) Hold and Wait – a process holding resources waits for more (e.g., holding file A, waiting for file B). (3) No Preemption – resources cannot be forcibly taken; they must be released voluntarily.

    idealAnswer: "Banker's Algorithm avoids deadlock by simulating resource allocation before granting. A 'safe state' means there exists a 'safe sequence' where each process can obtain needed resources, finish, and release them for the next. Key matrices: Max (maximum need), Allocation (currently allocated), Need = Max - Allocation, Available (free resources). When a process requests resources, the algorithm checks if granting them keeps the system in a safe state. If yes, grant; otherwise, the process must wait.",

Avoidance: use algorithms (Banker's) to ensure the system never enters unsafe states; requires advance knowledge of maximum resource needs. Detection and Recovery: allow deadlock to occur, periodically run detection algorithms (wait-for graph), then recover by terminating processes or preempting resources.

To enter, process i sets flag[i]=true and turn=j, then waits while flag[j] is true AND turn==j. Upon exit, flag[i]=false. Mutual exclusion: only one can be in critical section since both conditions flag and turn cannot both favor both processes simultaneously. Progress: a process exits the loop in finite time. Bounded waiting: process i waits at most one turn for process j. However, it may not work on modern CPUs without memory barriers.",

Semaphore: an integer counter supporting multiple instances. wait() decrements; signal() increments. Counting semaphores allow N concurrent accesses (e.g., N buffers). Prefer semaphore when: controlling access to a pool of N identical resources, signaling between producers and consumers.

    idealAnswer: "A monitor is a high-level synchronization construct that encapsulates shared data and operations. Mutual exclusion is automatic – only one process can execute inside the monitor at any time. Condition variables (wait() and signal()) allow processes to suspend inside the monitor until a condition is met. Unlike semaphores, monitors don't require programmers to manually call lock/unlock around critical sections, reducing programming errors. Semaphores require careful placement of wait/signal; incorrect use can lead to deadlock or mutual exclusion violations.",

Resource Sharing – threads share code, data, and open files of the parent process, reducing resource consumption compared to separate processes.

If 25% of a program is serial, maximum speedup with infinite cores is 1/0.25 = 4x, regardless of cores added.
